											<p>Love.. love.. extracting insights from data</p>
										</header>
										<p>I am absolutely fascinated by patterns in nature. Whether it is examining the intricate details of a leaf or observing the structure of entire galaxies of stars, Data Science gives us an enormous capacity to understand the world around us. I am passionate about exploring, learning about and building projects involving all things Data Science. I also love contributing to non-profit organizations such as <a href="http://www.datakind.org/">Datakind</a> and further developing my skills by investing in on-line learning at Udacity <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>. In my spare time I am into gardening, reading and wandering in nature :-)</p>

												<h3><a href="https://github.com/DeepthiMo/Sense-your-City">Sense Your city</a></h3>
												<p>As a child I suffered from asthma. Any person who has gone through similar experience becomes acutely aware of the importance of the quality of the air we are breathe. As I was looking for data related hackathons I came across this awesome dataset by <a href="http://datacanvas.org/sense-your-city/">DataCanvas</a>. The dataset contains measurements such as temperature and dust level, collected by citizen's DIY sensors. Sense your city is a pretty exciting project put together by Data Canvas. I live in bay area now, so I got curious and started exploring the data from sensors located in San Francisco. <a href="https://github.com/DeepthiMo/Sense-your-City">Code</a> is in github.</p>

												<h3><a href="https://github.com/DeepthiMo/Projects/blob/master/filtering%20email/spam%20filtering.ipynb">Spam Detection</a></h3>
												<p>The goal of this project is to classify email as spam or not. This project was a great learning experience in understanding how to apply the results from machine learning models in real life. For example, it is useful to distinguish spam from good emails. However it is even more important to ensure that good emails are never classified as spam. <a href="https://github.com/DeepthiMo/Projects/blob/master/filtering%20email/spam%20filtering.ipynb">Code</a> is in github.</p>

												<h3><a href="https://github.com/DeepthiMo/Projects/blob/master/yummly%20NLP/Baseline%20V0.2%20deepthi.ipynb">Yummly</a></h3>
												<p>This is another interesting <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> project. Yummly website is a repository of recipes. The Kaggle data set consists of the ingredients in each recipe and the cuisine to which recipe belongs. Using NLP techniques, I processed the ingredients list and built a model to fit new data. This allows us to predict which cuisine the recipe belongs to based on which ingredients the recipe has. <a href="https://github.com/DeepthiMo/Projects/blob/master/yummly%20NLP/Baseline%20V0.2%20deepthi.ipynb">Code</a> is in github.</p>

												<h3><a href="https://github.com/DeepthiMo/Projects/blob/master/Titanic/Titanic%20V0.2b-2.ipynb">Titanic</a></h3>
												<p>This was my first <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> project and one I am particularly proud of building. I enjoyed doing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on this data set. I also learned to apply various techniques for dealing with missing values. The data set has information about the passengers on the infamous ship wreck and indicates whether or not the passengers survived. Using this data I built a model that predicted the likelihood of survival from available features in the data.  <a href="https://github.com/DeepthiMo/Projects/blob/master/Titanic/Titanic%20V0.2b-2.ipynb">Code</a> is in github.</p>
